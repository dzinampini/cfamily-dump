principle Inheritance{

principle Polymorphism{
	def(){
		programming mechanism that allows one class to have a number of class actions (ie to take many forms);
	}

	why(){
		promote independence;

principle Encapsulation{
	def(){
		combining attributes && methods in a class && restricting access to them;

	why(){
		promote security of data/code;

principle Abstraction{
	def(){
		hiding of implementation details from the user (that is method hiding);
	}

	why(){
		to provide generalisation/specialisation (thats why its linked to generic programming);
		to have a base class and not fully implement its methods;
