/*Intro to OOP 
Software Crisis Issues 
---------------------------------------------

1. designing systems with open interfaces 
2. ensuring code reusability 
3. improving software quality 
4. managing time schedules 
5. improving software product


Approaches to Programming
---------------------------------------------
they are kind of 3/4

Procedural(code controls access to data){
	problem is viewed as a sequence of problme sot be solved;
	and primary focus in solving the problems is the creation of functions;
	but now comes the problems that create large scale problems, functions won't really solve problems, thus we opt for OOP;
	Eg's of procedural programming languages (C, Cobal,); 	
}

Object Oriented Programming (data controls access to data){
	OOP treats data as a critical element in the program and hence does not allow it to freely flow around the system;
	it ties data more closely to the function which operates it and protects it from accidental modification; 
	the problem is further broken down into a number of entities called objects;
	Egs(){
		C++; 
		C#; 
		Java; 
		VB.Net; 
		Python; 
		PHP; 
	} 
	pros(){
		reuse of code; inheritance
		security of code and data; encapsulation
		easy to maintain programs;  
		time saving;
		independence of code; abstraction 
	}
	cons(){
		large program sizes;
		steep learning curves;
		relatively slower programs; 
	}
	-also see OOP principles 
}

Object Based Languages (){
	supports programming of objects but does not support inheritance and dynamic binding 

	Eg(){
		Javascript;
		VB script; 
	}
}
