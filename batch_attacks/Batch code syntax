Batch code syntax

call // used to call another batch file that already exists eg) call c:\batchfile.bat

echo // used to display information and commands on the screen/prevent them from being displayed.
@echo off //no message will be displayed // good because the user will not press exit button to stop execution of code
@echo on //cause all commands ina batch file to be displayed // but i think if you dont specify echo i think it will 				just display

for // used to select specific set of files and run commands on each of them 
 for (variable) 
 in(set of file) 
 do (commands)
eg) for (%%F) in(*.txt) do del("%%F")

goto // used as in swith statement // but here its specifically to repeat a code since there are no loop statements
eg) :begin
	//coode to execute
	goto x

if //executes an instruction provided a condition is met
	if exist C: \myfile.txt  (copy C:\myfile.txt D:\myfiles.txt)

	else echo myfile.txt does not exist
